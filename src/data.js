	Introduction:
		"I-Wei Lai received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering (GIEE) at National Taiwan University in 2011, and he is now an Assistant Professor in National Taiwan Normal University, Taiwan. He was a Research assistant with the Institute of Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany. He was the recipient of the NTU-GIEE best thesis award in 2011 for his Ph.D. thesis and is a member of Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society. His research interests include baseband signal processing, optimization, MIMO communication, and ad hoc cognitive radio network. He was recognized as an Exemplar Reviewer of IEEE Transactions on Communications, 2014.",
